## Description

The following set of tutorials form part of the **Tutorials Series** hosted
by "[Central American - Caribbean Bridge in Astrophysics Program](https://cencabridgeastro.weebly.com/)".

In these tutorials, we will cover how to:

- Extract datasets
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the datasets. This includes
    1. Extract summary statistics about the dataset
    2. Clean the datasets
    3. Transform columns to useful *features*
- Define and *train* a machine learning (ML) model using out-of-the-box utilities from Python packages.
- Determine the performance of the ML model

We will also discuss some common practices when dealing with ML models, as EDA best practices.
