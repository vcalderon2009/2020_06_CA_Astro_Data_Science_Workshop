    "\n",
    "This type of algorithm consists of a target which is to be predicted given a set of *predictors* (or features), which are\n",
    "independent from the `target` variable. Using these variables, one can create a **mapping** between the different\n",
    "**features** and the **target variable**.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$y = f(\\textrm{features})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm / model undergoes a **training** process, in which the model *learns* the functional form of *f* as a function\n",
    "of the features, and it tries to predict $y$ based on this mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning can be broken into 2 main branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classification**: Model is trained to *classify* something into certain classes\n",
    "    - Examples:\n",
    "        - Clasifying whether a patient has a certain disease or not\n",
    "        - Classify between elliptical and spiral galaxies\n",
    "        - Determine types of stars (*OBAFGKM*)\n",

    "        - Predicting stock prices based on historical data\n",
    "        - Predict how much a car will cost in 2, 3, or 4 years from now, based on its model and specifications.\n",

    "An example taken from [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/01/introduction-to-reinforcement-learning-implementation/)\n",
    "considers Reinforcement Learning as when a child is learning how to walk:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first thing the child will observe is to **notice** how you are walking. You use two legs, taking a step at a time in order to walk. Grasping this concept, the child tries to replicate you.\n",
    "2. But soon he/she will understand that before walking, the child has to stand up! This is a challenge that comes along while trying to walk. So now the child **attempts to get up**, staggering and slipping but still determinant to get up.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Then there’s another challenge to cope up with. Standing up was easy, but to **remain still** is another task altogether! Clutching thin air to find support, the child manages to stay standing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now the real task for the child is to start walking. But it’s easy to say than actually do it. There are so **many things to keep in mind**, like balancing the body weight, deciding which foot to put next and where to put it."
